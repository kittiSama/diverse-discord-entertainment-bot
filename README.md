# diverse-discord-entertainment-bot
A diverse discord bot I have created for discord's 1st hack week. 

The bot features various commands which I made for fun and maybe even win the grand prize. 
I had attempted to use many different discord features, such as normal text, voice chat, reactions, and sending images.

NOTICE: some features of the bot can only work when the bot is running on my computer, so in order to test those features,
please enter my discord server via the following link: https://discord.gg/pUFg6t3

I hope you will enjoy what my bot has to offer, and thank you for giving me this incredible opportunity.

With my best regards,
kittisama#7348.
